# Quick Sync Guide

## The Problem

Your local VS Code environment is out of sync with GitHub's main branch, which already has all the changes from PR #5 merged successfully.

## The Solution (2 Minutes)

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Easiest)

Open PowerShell in your repo directory and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\yahua\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\SynTechRev-PolyCodCal
.\sync-local-repo.ps1
```

The script will:
- ✓ Backup any uncommitted changes
- ✓ Clean git state
- ✓ Fetch latest from GitHub
- ✓ Switch to main branch
- ✓ Pull all updates from PR #5
- ✓ Verify everything works

### Option 2: Manual Steps (Quick)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\yahua\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\SynTechRev-PolyCodCal

# Save any local changes (optional)
git stash

# Clean and switch to main
git reset --hard HEAD
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Reopen VS Code
code .
```

### Option 3: Fresh Start (Nuclear Option)

If nothing else works:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\yahua\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\

# Backup current repo
Rename-Item SynTechRev-PolyCodCal SynTechRev-PolyCodCal-backup

# Fresh clone
git clone https://github.com/SynTechRev/SynTechRev-PolyCodCal.git
cd SynTechRev-PolyCodCal
code .
```

## What's Included from PR #5

Once synced, your local repo will have:

✅ **Documentation:**
- QUICKSTART.md - 5-minute setup guide
- CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guidelines
- CODE_REPAIR_STRATEGY.md - Code quality guide
- docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md - Development process
- docs/INDEX.md - Documentation hub

✅ **VS Code Configuration:**
- .vscode/settings.json - Python, testing, formatting
- .vscode/tasks.json - One-click quality checks
- .vscode/launch.json - Debug configurations
- .vscode/extensions.json - Recommended extensions
- .vscode/README.md - VS Code guide

✅ **Everything Working:**
- All 15 tests passing
- Auto-format on save (Black)
- Integrated testing (pytest)
- Type checking (mypy/Pylance)

## Verification

After syncing, check these work:

```powershell
# Tests should pass
pytest -v
# Expected: 15 passed

# Git should be clean
git status
# Expected: "working tree clean"

# Should be on main
git branch
# Expected: "* main"
```

## Key Point

**Nothing is broken!** The GitHub repository is perfect. You just need to sync your local VS Code environment with it.
