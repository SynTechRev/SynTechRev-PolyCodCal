## Issues Resolved

### Critical Issues Fixed ✅

1. **requirements.txt Encoding Issue**

   - Status: ✅ FIXED

3. **Missing Console Script Entry Points**
   - Problem: CLI tools not installable as console scripts
   - Impact: Users couldn't run tools after pip install
   - Solution: Added all three entry points to pyproject.toml
   - Status: ✅ FIXED

4. **Incomplete Phase 7 Preparation**
   - Problem: Phase 7 prerequisites not documented
   - Impact: Unclear what needed to be done
   - Solution: Created comprehensive readiness documentation
   - Status: ✅ FIXED

## Changes Implemented

### 1. requirements.txt
**Problem:** UTF-16LE encoding prevented pip from reading file  
**Solution:** Converted to UTF-8 encoding

```diff
- (UTF-16LE binary data)
+ certifi==2025.10.5
+ charset-normalizer==3.4.3
+ numpy==2.3.3
+ pandas==2.3.3
+ ... (all dependencies now readable)
```

### 2. pyproject.toml
**Problem:** Outdated Poetry-style metadata, no console scripts  
**Solution:** Migrated to PEP 621 with comprehensive metadata

```toml
[project]
name = "syntechrev-polycodcal"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Feedback monitoring system with sliding-window aggregation..."
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "certifi>=2025.10.5",
    "numpy>=2.3.3",
    "pandas>=2.3.3",
    # ... all dependencies with versions
]

[project.scripts]
syntech-monitor = "syntechrev_polycodcal.feedback_monitor:main"
genesis-gateway = "syntechrev_polycodcal.genesis_gateway:main"
legal-generator = "syntechrev_polycodcal.legal_generator.cli:main"
```

### 3. feedback_monitor.py
**Problem:** No main() function for console script entry point  
**Solution:** Added comprehensive main() function

```python
def main() -> int:
    """CLI entry point for feedback monitor.
    
    Usage: syntech-monitor path/to/events.jsonl
    """
    import json
    import sys
    
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: syntech-monitor path/to/events.jsonl")
        return 2
    
    # ... implementation with error handling
```

### 4. setup.cfg
**Problem:** Duplicate metadata conflicting with pyproject.toml  
**Solution:** Removed metadata section, kept only [options] and [flake8]

### 5. README.md
**Problem:** Missing installation instructions and console script docs  
**Solution:** Added comprehensive installation and usage sections

### 6. CHANGELOG.md
**Problem:** Phase 6 and 7 changes not documented  
**Solution:** Added complete change history

### 7. PHASE7_READINESS.md
**Problem:** No consolidated Phase 7 readiness documentation  
**Solution:** Created comprehensive 12KB readiness report
