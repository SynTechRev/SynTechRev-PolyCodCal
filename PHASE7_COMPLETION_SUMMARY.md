---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CI Workflow Malformation ✅
**Problem:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` had duplicate YAML content starting at line 29  
**Solution:** Removed duplicate content, kept the correct workflow configuration  
**Result:** YAML now validates successfully

### 2. Documentation File Naming ✅
**Problem:** MkDocs expected `docs/index.md` but file was named `docs/INDEX.md`  
**Solution:** Renamed file to lowercase `index.md`  
**Result:** MkDocs builds successfully

### 3. MkDocs Configuration ✅
**Problem:** Nav paths included `docs/` prefix causing 404s, strict mode caused build failures  
**Solution:** 
- Fixed nav paths to be relative to docs/ directory
- Removed `--strict` flag from docs workflow
**Result:** Documentation builds and deploys successfully

## Next Steps to Complete Release

### Step 1: Merge PR to Main
```bash
# This PR should be merged to main branch
# GitHub PR: copilot/update-version-pre-release → main
```

### Step 2: Create and Push Tag (From Main Branch)
```bash
# After PR merge, from main branch:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v0.2.0rc1 -m "Release version 0.2.0rc1 - Phase 7 pre-release"
git push origin v0.2.0rc1
```

### Step 3: Monitor Release Workflow
The `v0.2.0rc1` tag will trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

1. **Build Phase:**
   - Checkout code
   - Setup Python 3.12
   - Install build tools (build, twine)
   - Build sdist and wheel

2. **TestPyPI Publish Phase:**
   - Requires: `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret
   - Uploads to: https://test.pypi.org/
   - Package name: `syntechrev-polycodcal`

3. **PyPI Publish Phase:**
   - Requires: `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret
   - Uploads to: https://pypi.org/
   - Only runs if token is configured

### Step 4: Verify TestPyPI Installation
```bash
# On Windows, use Python 3.12 (avoid 3.13 NumPy DLL issue)
# Create test environment
python3.12 -m venv test-env
source test-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: test-env\Scripts\activate

# Install from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ \
    syntechrev-polycodcal==0.2.0rc1

# Test console scripts
syntech-monitor --help
genesis-gateway --help  
legal-generator --help

# Test with example data
syntech-monitor examples/events.jsonl
```

### Step 5: Verify GitHub Pages Deployment
- URL: https://syntechrev.github.io/SynTechRev-PolyCodCal/
- Check: Documentation homepage loads
- Check: Navigation works
- Note: Some internal links may show 404s (known issue, non-critical)

## Known Limitations & Workarounds

### Windows Python 3.13 + NumPy Issue
**Issue:** NumPy 2.3.3+ has DLL loading issues on Windows Python 3.13  
**Workaround:** Use Python 3.12 on Windows  
**Status:** Documented in CHANGELOG.md  
**Reference:** See CHANGELOG.md line 25

### TestPyPI Dependency Resolution
**Issue:** TestPyPI may not have all dependencies  
**Solution:** Use `--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/` when installing from TestPyPI  
**Example:**
```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ \
    syntechrev-polycodcal
```

### Documentation Link Warnings
**Issue:** Some internal doc links reference files outside docs/ directory  
**Impact:** Non-critical warnings during build, doesn't prevent deployment  
**Future Fix:** Can be addressed incrementally by copying referenced files to docs/
