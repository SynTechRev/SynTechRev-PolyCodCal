      # For maintainers: To analyze PR head code (not recommended for untrusted PRs),
      # you would need a second checkout step like:
      # - name: Checkout PR head (for analysis only, no secrets)
      #   uses: actions/checkout@v4
      #   with:
      #     repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}
