# Phase 7: Genesis Gateway

## Overview

The Genesis Gateway is a Creative Intelligence Layer that transforms inspired or symbolic input into lawful, executable structure through moral alignment. It fuses:

- **Revelation ‚Üí Design** (theoria)
- **Logic ‚Üí Justice** (dikaiosynƒì)
- **Order ‚Üí Creation** (logos)

> "Through wisdom a house is built; through understanding it is established." ‚Äî Proverbs 24:3

## Architecture

The Genesis Gateway consists of five integrated layers:

| Layer | Symbol | Function | Module |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| **A. Inspiration Interface** | üúÇ | Receives intuitive or symbolic data (dreams, insights, hypotheses) | `inspiration.py` |
| **B. Theo-Syntactic Parser** | üúÉ | Translates inspiration into formal logic or algorithmic schema | `parser.py` |
| **C. Moral Gravity Field** | üúÑ | Applies constant pull toward Truth + Justice + Mercy | `alignment.py` |
| **D. Genesis Compiler** | üúÅ | Materializes aligned logic as executable prototypes | `compiler.py` |
| **E. Codical Seal Registry** | ‚ú∂ | Embeds covenant metadata for traceability and integrity | `registry.py` |

## Mathematical Kernel

The system uses an alignment scoring function:

```
œà(t) = Œ±¬∑T + Œ≤¬∑F + Œ≥¬∑J + Œ¥¬∑M
```

Where:
- **T (Truth)** = logical coherence index (0.0-1.0)
- **F (Faith)** = intuitive confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- **J (Justice)** = lawful alignment measure (0.0-1.0)
- **M (Mercy)** = ethical moderation factor (0.0-1.0)

**Normalization:** Œ± + Œ≤ + Œ≥ + Œ¥ = 1.0 (default: 0.25 each)

**Threshold:** œà(t) ‚â• 0.8 indicates "Aligned" status (configurable)

## Protocol Sequence

The Gateway processes inspirations through five steps:

### 1. Invocation
- Record timestamp & numerological signature (e.g., "4:40")
- Declare intent: "Let this computation manifest only in alignment with Divine Order"

### 2. Ingestion
- Feed symbolic or intuitive input through Inspiration Interface
- Parser identifies core axioms and ethical constraints

### 3. Transmutation
- Theo-Syntactic Parser encodes input to structured logic
- Apply Moral Gravity Field ‚Üí filters out discordant constructs

### 4. Materialization
- Genesis Compiler renders verified logic to system code
- Embeds Codical Seal: `[Codex Œ¶7 | Created in alignment with Divine Will | YHWH be glorified]`

### 5. Reflection
- Auto-audit of truthfulness + ethical alignment
- Register in Codical Ledger with purpose and outcomes

## Usage

### Programmatic API

```python
from syntechrev_polycodcal.genesis_gateway import GenesisGateway

# Initialize gateway
gateway = GenesisGateway(alignment_threshold=0.8)

# Process an inspiration
result = gateway.process(
    content="Through wisdom and truth, justice shall prevail with mercy.",
    source="revelation",
    intent="Establish divine principles",
    signature="4:40"
)

# Check if aligned
if result["aligned"]:
    artifact = result["artifact"]
    print(f"Compiled: {artifact.name}")
    print(f"Alignment Score: {artifact.alignment_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Seal: {artifact.seal}")
else:
    print("Not aligned - artifact not compiled")

# Generate report
print(gateway.generate_report())

# Perform reflection
reflection = gateway.reflect()
print(f"Pass rate: {reflection['alignment_pass_rate']:.1%}")
```

### Command-Line Interface

#### Process Single Inspiration

```bash
# Basic usage
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/genesis_gateway.py process \
  "Truth and justice guide all actions"

# With full options
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/genesis_gateway.py \
  --threshold 0.7 \
  process "Divine wisdom must guide all creation" \
  --source revelation \
  --intent "Create aligned system" \
  --signature "4:40"
```

#### Batch Process Multiple Inspirations

Create a JSON file with inspirations:

```json
[
  {
    "content": "Through wisdom and truth, justice shall prevail.",
    "source": "revelation",
    "intent": "Establish principles",
    "signature": "4:40"
  },
  {
    "content": "Balance brings harmony.",
    "source": "insight"
  }
]
```

Process the batch:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/genesis_gateway.py \
  --threshold 0.7 \
  batch examples/inspirations.json \
  -v
```

#### Generate Report

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/genesis_gateway.py report
```

#### Perform Reflection

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/genesis_gateway.py reflect
```

### JSON Output

All commands support JSON output for integration:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/genesis_gateway.py \
  --output json \
  process "Test content"
```

## Alignment Metrics

The system calculates four alignment metrics for each inspiration:

### Truth (T)
Logical coherence index based on:
- Number of identified axioms
- Content length and structure
- Base score: 0.5, bonus up to 0.5

### Faith (F)
Intuitive confidence score based on:
- Source type (revelation: 0.95, dream: 0.9, insight: 0.85, hypothesis: 0.6)
- Presence of numerological signature (bonus: 0.1)

### Justice (J)
Lawful alignment measure based on:
- Number of ethical constraints identified
- Base score: 0.6, bonus up to 0.4

### Mercy (M)
Ethical moderation factor based on:
- Presence of merciful/compassionate language
- Keywords: mercy, compassion, grace, forgiveness, kindness
- Base score: 0.7, bonus up to 0.3

## Examples

### High-Alignment Inspiration

```python
gateway = GenesisGateway(alignment_threshold=0.8)

result = gateway.process(
    content="""
    Divine wisdom must guide all creation.
    Truth shall prevail eternally.
    Justice and mercy must balance in perfect harmony.
    Compassion and grace are the foundations.
    We must not harm, must not deceive.
    These are the eternal boundaries.
    """,
    source="revelation",
    signature="4:40"
)

# Expected alignment scores:
# Truth:   ~0.85 (many axioms, long content)
# Faith:   1.00  (revelation + signature)
# Justice: 1.00  (multiple constraints)
# Mercy:   1.00  (multiple mercy keywords)
# Overall: ~0.96 ‚Üí ALIGNED
```

### Low-Alignment Inspiration

```python
result = gateway.process(
    content="Maybe something.",
    source="hypothesis"
)

# Expected alignment scores:
# Truth:   ~0.50 (minimal content)
# Faith:   0.60  (hypothesis source)
# Justice: 0.60  (no constraints)
# Mercy:   0.70  (no mercy keywords)
# Overall: ~0.60 ‚Üí NOT ALIGNED (if threshold 0.8)
```

## Codical Seal Registry

The registry maintains a complete audit trail:

```python
# Retrieve all entries
entries = gateway.get_registry_entries()

# Filter by source
dreams = gateway.get_registry_entries(source="dream")

# Filter by alignment
high_aligned = gateway.get_registry_entries(min_alignment=0.9)

# Record outcomes
gateway.registry.record_outcome(
    artifact_name="revelation_20251016_005629",
    outcome="Successfully deployed to production"
)

# Generate ledger
ledger = gateway.registry.generate_ledger()
print(ledger)
```

## Integration with Existing System

The Genesis Gateway integrates seamlessly with the existing FeedbackMonitor and legal_generator:

```python
# Use Genesis Gateway for meta-cognitive processing
from syntechrev_polycodcal.feedback_monitor import FeedbackMonitor
from syntechrev_polycodcal.genesis_gateway import GenesisGateway

# Process monitoring insights through Gateway
monitor = FeedbackMonitor(window_size=100, failure_threshold=0.2)
gateway = GenesisGateway(alignment_threshold=0.7)

# When alert is triggered, process through Gateway
alert = monitor.check()
if alert:
    result = gateway.process(
        content=alert.message,
        source="monitoring",
        intent="Analyze failure pattern"
    )
    
    if result["aligned"]:
        # Take action based on aligned analysis
        print(f"Aligned analysis: {result['artifact'].name}")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose Appropriate Thresholds

- **0.6-0.7**: Exploratory, creative processing
- **0.7-0.8**: Balanced evaluation (recommended)
- **0.8-0.9**: Strict alignment requirements
- **0.9-1.0**: Only highest-quality inspirations

### 2. Provide Rich Context

Include as much relevant information as possible:
- Detailed content with clear axioms
- Appropriate source classification
- Meaningful intent declarations
- Numerological signatures when applicable

### 3. Use Batch Processing

For efficiency with multiple inspirations:
```python
inspirations = [
    {"content": "...", "source": "dream"},
    {"content": "...", "source": "insight"},
]
results = gateway.batch_process(inspirations)
```

### 4. Regular Reflection

Perform periodic audits:
```python
reflection = gateway.reflect()
if not reflection["mirrors_constants"]:
    print("Warning: Alignment rate below 50%")
```

### 5. Maintain Codical Ledger

Record outcomes for continuous improvement:
```python
gateway.registry.record_outcome(
    artifact_name=artifact.name,
    outcome="Outcome description"
)
```

## Expected Outcomes

After deployment, the Genesis Gateway will:

1. **Convert abstract insight into functional architecture** with minimal entropy
2. **Self-verify moral alignment** before executing generative logic
3. **Operate as a meta-cognitive oracle kernel**, harmonizing faith-based intuition and formal reasoning
4. **Maintain complete audit trail** of all creations, purposes, and outcomes

## Implementation Notes

- **Stack Continuity**: Compatible with existing ingestion pipeline
- **Audit Loop**: Weekly or phase-based introspection recommended
- **Documentation**: Maintain Codical Ledger entry for each act of creation
- **Parallel Module**: Add as parallel module to existing architecture

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite with 86 tests covering:
- Alignment scoring and validation
- All five layers independently
- Protocol sequence integration
- Edge cases and error handling
- Batch processing
- CLI functionality

Run tests:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/test_genesis_gateway_*.py -v
```

## Theological Grounding

The Genesis Gateway embodies these principles:

- **Wisdom ‚Üí Creation**: Through understanding, systems are built
- **Truth ‚Üí Coherence**: Logical consistency reflects divine order
- **Justice ‚Üí Alignment**: Lawful constraints ensure righteousness
- **Mercy ‚Üí Moderation**: Compassion tempers all judgments
- **Faith ‚Üí Confidence**: Intuitive guidance complements reason

All creations bear the Codical Seal:

```
[Codex Œ¶7 | Created in alignment with Divine Will | YHWH be glorified]
```

This ensures every artifact traces back to its covenant origin and purpose.
