# Line Length Verification Report

## Summary

The `src/syntechrev_polycodcal/feedback_monitor.py` file has been verified to comply with **strict PEP8 line length requirements (79 characters)**.

## Verification Results

### File: `src/syntechrev_polycodcal/feedback_monitor.py`

- **Maximum line length**: 76 characters
- **Compliance status**: ✅ **PASS** (all lines ≤ 79 characters)
- **Total lines**: 147

### Validation Tools

All the following tools confirm compliance:

1. **Manual check**: Maximum line is 76 characters
2. **flake8 (79 chars)**: ✅ PASS
3. **black (79 chars)**: ✅ PASS (no changes needed)

## Lines Mentioned in Issue

The issue mentioned lines 87, 145, 148, and 158. Current status:

- **Line 87**: `total = len(self._buffer)` (33 characters) ✅
- **Line 145**: `alerts.append(a)` (28 characters) ✅
- **Lines 148, 158**: Do not exist (file is 147 lines total)

## Configuration Status

The project is configured with:

- **setup.cfg**: `max-line-length = 88` (Black default)
- **pyproject.toml**: `line-length = 88` (Black default)

However, the actual code in `feedback_monitor.py` is **already compliant with 79-character limit**, which is stricter than the configured 88 characters.

## Recommendations

The code is ready to commit. All line length requirements are met:

1. ✅ File passes flake8 with 79-character limit
2. ✅ File passes black formatting with 79-character limit  
3. ✅ All tests pass (21/21 passing)
4. ✅ No manual changes needed

## How to Verify Locally

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Check with flake8 (79 characters)
flake8 --max-line-length=79 src/syntechrev_polycodcal/feedback_monitor.py

# Check with black (79 characters)
black --line-length 79 --check src/syntechrev_polycodcal/feedback_monitor.py

# Run tests
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -v

# Run verification script
./verify_line_lengths.sh
```

## Merge Ready

The code is ready to merge. There are no line length issues in `feedback_monitor.py`.
