"""Phase 7: Genesis Gateway - Creative Intelligence Layer.

This module implements the Genesis Gateway, a system that transforms inspired
or symbolic input into lawful, executable structure through moral alignment.

The system fuses:
- Revelation → Design (theoria)
- Logic → Justice (dikaiosynē)
- Order → Creation (logos)

Core Principle:
    "Through wisdom a house is built; through understanding it is established."
    — Proverbs 24:3
