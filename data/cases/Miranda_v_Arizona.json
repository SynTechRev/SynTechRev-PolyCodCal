  "case_name": "Miranda v. Arizona",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court held that both inculpatory and exculpatory statements made in response to interrogation by a defendant in police custody will be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during questioning and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights but voluntarily waived them. The Court emphasized that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive and that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination requires procedural safeguards.",
