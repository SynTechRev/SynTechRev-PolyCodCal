  "case_name": "Brown v. Board of Education",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court unanimously held that racial segregation of children in public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court found that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, even if the physical facilities and tangible factors may be equal. This landmark decision overturned the 'separate but equal' doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson and became a catalyst for the civil rights movement.",
