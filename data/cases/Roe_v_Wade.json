  "case_name": "Roe v. Wade",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court held that the Constitution protects a woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. The Court found that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extends to a woman's decision to have an abortion. The decision established a trimester framework for evaluating abortion regulations and balanced state interests in protecting potential life and maternal health against the constitutional right to privacy.",
