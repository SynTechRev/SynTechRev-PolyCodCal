# Governance

## Overview

This document describes the governance model for SynTechRev-PolyCodCal. Our governance prioritizes transparency, consensus, and alignment with the project's ethical-theological values.

## Project Values

SynTechRev-PolyCodCal is guided by the following principles:

- **Technology as Service**: Code should serve human flourishing and justice
- **Code as Stewardship**: We are responsible custodians of tools that impact others
- **Community as Covenant**: We build together in good faith and mutual accountability

These values inform all decisions, from technical architecture to community interactions.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers

**Current Maintainers**: See [MAINTAINER_INSTRUCTIONS.md](MAINTAINER_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

Maintainers have:

- **Repository Write Access**: Can merge PRs, create releases, and manage issues
- **Decision Authority**: Final say on technical direction and feature acceptance
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Review and merge pull requests
  - Maintain code quality and test coverage
  - Respond to issues and security reports
  - Guide project direction and roadmap
  - Uphold the Code of Conduct
  - Ensure documentation stays current

**Becoming a Maintainer**:
- Consistent high-quality contributions over time
- Deep understanding of the codebase
- Demonstrated commitment to project values
- Nominated by an existing maintainer
- Consensus approval from all maintainers

### Contributors

Anyone can contribute to SynTechRev-PolyCodCal by:

- Submitting pull requests
- Reporting bugs and suggesting features
- Improving documentation
- Participating in discussions
- Helping other users

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.

### Users

Users are individuals or organizations that use SynTechRev-PolyCodCal. Their feedback and needs help shape the project's direction.

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus-First Approach

We strive for consensus on all significant decisions:

1. **Proposal**: Anyone can propose changes via GitHub Issues or Discussions
2. **Discussion**: Community members discuss the proposal
3. **Refinement**: The proposal is refined based on feedback
4. **Consensus Check**: Maintainers assess whether consensus exists
5. **Decision**: If consensus is reached, the proposal is accepted

**What Requires Consensus**:
- Major features or architectural changes
- Breaking API changes
- Changes to governance or values
- Addition or removal of maintainers
- License or security policy changes

**What Doesn't Require Consensus**:
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Non-breaking enhancements
- Routine maintenance

### When Consensus Cannot Be Reached

If consensus cannot be reached after good-faith discussion:

1. **Extended Discussion**: Allow more time for deliberation (typically 1-2 weeks)
2. **Compromise**: Seek a middle-ground solution
3. **Maintainer Vote**: As a last resort, maintainers vote (simple majority wins)
4. **Tie-Breaking**: The most senior maintainer (by tenure) breaks ties
5. **Documentation**: Record the decision and rationale

We prefer consensus to voting whenever possible.

## Change Proposal Process

For significant changes:

1. **Open an Issue**: Start with a GitHub Issue describing the proposal
   - Title: `[Proposal] Brief description`
   - Include: motivation, alternatives considered, implementation approach
   - Tag with `proposal` label

2. **Gather Feedback**: Allow at least 7 days for community input
   - Respond to questions and concerns
   - Refine the proposal based on feedback
   - Update the issue with revisions

3. **Consensus Assessment**: Maintainers assess whether consensus exists
   - Look for broad support from contributors and users
   - Address any blocking concerns
   - Document areas of agreement and disagreement

4. **Decision**: Maintainers make a final decision
   - Accept: Proposal moves to implementation
   - Defer: More information or discussion needed
   - Reject: Explain reasoning and close the issue

5. **Implementation**: If accepted, create a PR
   - Reference the proposal issue
   - Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines
   - Maintain quality standards

## Release Process

Releases follow semantic versioning (SemVer):

- **Major (x.0.0)**: Breaking changes
- **Minor (0.x.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (0.0.x)**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

**Release Authority**: Maintainers approve releases

**Release Workflow**:
1. All tests pass, quality checks green
2. CHANGELOG updated
3. Version bumped in `pyproject.toml`
4. Tag created (e.g., `v0.2.1`)
5. Automated workflow publishes to PyPI

See [TAGGING_GUIDE.md](TAGGING_GUIDE.md) for detailed release procedures.

## Security Governance

Security is taken seriously:

- **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities reported privately via GitHub Security Advisories or email
- **Response Timeline**: Acknowledgment within 72 hours, fix within 14 days for critical issues
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with reporters on disclosure timing
- **Security Updates**: Prioritized and released ASAP

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full security policy.

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

Our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all project spaces.

**Enforcement Process**:
1. Report received via email to `you@example.com`
2. Maintainers review and investigate (within 7 days)
3. Decision made based on severity
4. Action taken (warning, temporary ban, permanent ban)
5. Reporter and subject notified of outcome
6. Decision documented privately for accountability

**Appeal Process**:
- Appeals may be submitted to maintainers
- Different maintainer(s) review the appeal
- Final decision communicated within 14 days

## Conflict Resolution

For conflicts between contributors:

1. **Direct Resolution**: Parties attempt to resolve directly
2. **Mediation**: A maintainer mediates if needed
3. **Maintainer Decision**: Maintainers make a final decision if mediation fails
4. **Code of Conduct**: Enforcement process applies if conduct violations occurred

We prioritize respectful dialogue and assume good faith.

## Roadmap and Prioritization

The project roadmap is maintained in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

**Prioritization Criteria**:
- **P0**: Critical bugs, security issues, unblockers
- **P1**: Important features, significant improvements
- **P2**: Nice-to-have features, long-term goals

**Roadmap Updates**:
- Maintainers update the roadmap quarterly
- Community input welcomed via issues and discussions
- Alignment with project values is essential

## Changing Governance

This governance document can be modified through the consensus process:

1. Propose changes via a GitHub Issue
2. Allow at least 14 days for community discussion
3. Require consensus among all maintainers
4. Document changes in git history

Governance changes should be rare and carefully considered.

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, proposals
- **GitHub Discussions**: Questions, ideas, general discussion
- **Pull Requests**: Code contributions
- **Email** (`you@example.com`): Security reports, Code of Conduct issues, private matters

We do not currently have a chat platform (Slack, Discord, etc.). GitHub is our primary communication hub.

## Attribution and Acknowledgment

We recognize contributions in:

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Credits for significant features and fixes
- **Contributors List**: Automatically generated from git history
- **Release Notes**: Acknowledgment of major contributors
- **README.md**: Links to contributor graphs

Contributors may request to remain anonymous.
